//! Application actions module (currently unused).
//!
//! This module is reserved for future expansion of the action system.
//! Currently, all device actions and state mutations are handled directly
//! in the main application module (`app/mod.rs`) for simplicity.
//!
//! # Future Use
//!
//! This module may be used in the future to:
//! - Define structured action types for state mutations
//! - Implement a command pattern for undo/redo functionality
//! - Separate action processing from the main application logic
//! - Create a middleware system for action processing
//!
//! # Current Implementation
//!
//! Device operations such as start, stop, delete, and create are currently
//! processed directly in the event handling logic of `app/mod.rs`.
