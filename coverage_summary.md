## Key Testing Strategies

1. **MockBackend for UI Tests**
   - Direct function testing without full app
   - Text assertion capabilities
   - Layout verification

2. **MockCommandExecutor for Managers**
   - Simulate CLI responses
   - Test error paths
   - No real SDK required

3. **Focus Areas**
   - Business logic over UI chrome
   - Error handling paths
   - State transitions
   - Cache behavior

## Expected Outcomes

- 70% overall test coverage achieved
- All critical paths tested
- Improved code reliability
- Maintainable test suite
- CI/CD ready testing infrastructure
